    content: `## Introduction

ChatGPT and similar AI chatbots have burst onto the scene in recent years, proving their ability to generate 
human-like responses and handle complex questions. But can such a language model find a place on a Good $
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) shop floor? If you're a GMP inspector or quality professional 
(at Swissmedic, FDA, EMA, or elsewhere), you might soon encounter an operator chatting with a machine to 
retrieve data or guidance. 

Is this something we need to address in inspections? The short answer is **yes** – we should care. 
This article explains why, focusing on the chatbot component of these systems. We'll break down what language 
models are, how to recognize them, why they matter for GMP compliance, and what "good" vs "bad" implementations 
look like in a regulated context. Finally, we provide a checklist of signs and questions an inspector can use 
when evaluating such AI-driven tools on site.

## What is a Language Model (LM)?

At its core, a language model is an AI system trained to understand and generate human language. Simply put, it takes a sequence of words (for example, a question or prompt) and predicts the most likely next words to form a coherent response. Modern large language models like GPT-4 or Google's Bard are trained on enormous amounts of text, which gives them an almost uncanny ability to produce fluent, contextually relevant answers. When you interact with ChatGPT, you're seeing an LM complete your sentences or answer questions based on patterns it learned from vast data. Importantly, language models don't "think" or retrieve information the way a database or search engine does – they generate responses by statistical prediction. This means they can produce information that sounds convincing. In many applications, LMs are used as sub-components: for instance, a helpdesk chatbot that answers user queries, or a document assistant that summarizes reports. In a GMP software context, an LM might be integrated to allow users to query equipment data or SOPs in natural language. The LM is typically one part of a larger application (with a user interface, business logic, databases, etc.), rather than a stand-alone system.

## How to Recognize a ChatGPT-like Application

How do you know if you're looking at a language-model-driven app, especially if it's not blatantly labeled "ChatGPT"? Here are some tell-tale signs:

- **Natural Language Chat Interface:** The most obvious indicator is a chatbox or messenger-style interface where the user can type questions in everyday language and receive answers. For example, a prompt like "Ask the Assistant" or a digital assistant character on a machine's screen likely involves an LM. Unlike traditional software (which might have fixed menus or form fields), an LM-driven interface invites open-ended questions ("What were the last batch's autoclave parameters?") and provides elaborate textual answers.

- **Human-like Responses:** If the system gives detailed, well-phrased explanations or instructions that read like a person wrote them (rather than just displaying raw data or error codes), there's probably a language model behind it. LMs can paraphrase information, provide summaries, and even inject a conversational tone. This is distinct from a simple query tool or report, which would typically just fetch exact values or pre-written lines. An AI answer might say, "The autoclave completed 20 cycles last week, all within the validated temperature range," whereas a traditional system might show a table of cycle data and leave the interpretation to the user.

- **Flexibility in Queries:** Language models can handle a variety of inputs – you might notice the system doesn't require exact commands. Whether you ask "Show me yesterday's autoclave readings" or "What was the temperature profile on Feb 2nd?" you get a sensible answer. Such flexibility (understanding different phrasings) suggests an LM is interpreting the intent behind your words, rather than a simple keyword search.

- **AI or Assistant Branding:** Sometimes the presence of an LM is hinted by branding or naming. Terms like "AI Assistant," "Powered by AI," "Chatbot," or even a cutesy name for the assistant (e.g. "Smart QA Helper") in the application are strong clues. The system might also provide usage tips like "Ask me anything about the machine" or display an avatar – again pointing to an AI-driven component.

- **Non-deterministic or Creative Outputs:** This is more subtle to spot, but if you notice that repeated queries yield slightly different answers or wording, it indicates an LM. Traditional coded algorithms are deterministic (the same input gives the same output every time). Large language models, on the other hand, often have some randomness in their response generation. For example, ask twice "How many batches failed last month?" – a pure database query tool would always return the same fixed number or list. An AI chatbot might say "None of the batches in January failed; all met quality criteria." another time it might phrase it "All batches in January were within specifications, so there were zero failures." The core fact is the same, but the wording varies. This variability is a hallmark of generative LMs. (Note: such non-determinism is actually a red flag in regulated environments because consistency of outputs is expected – more on that later.)

- **Complex Language Understanding:** An LM can handle complex or context-dependent questions. For instance, "Is there anything in the autoclave log that looks unusual?" is a pretty high-level prompt. If the system attempts to interpret this and respond (e.g. "No anomalies were detected; all parameters are within normal ranges"), it's using an AI model to parse what "unusual" means in context and to analyze data for you. This goes beyond standard pre-programmed logic.

In summary, if the system you're inspecting behaves like you're having a conversation with a knowledgeable human or an expert system – freely accepting questions and giving extensive answers – you are likely dealing with a language model-driven application. As inspectors, recognizing this is the first step to evaluating it properly.

## Why Should Regulators Care About LMs in GMP?

You might wonder: if an AI chatbot is just answering questions, not actually manufacturing anything, is it really a GMP compliance concern? **Absolutely.** Any tool that assists in making decisions or handling GMP data can impact product quality and patient safety, so it falls under regulatory expectations for control and validation. Regulators worldwide have started paying close attention to artificial intelligence in regulated industries. In fact, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and PIC/S have drafted new guidelines (e.g. a proposed Annex 22) specifically addressing AI in GMP, covering aspects like defining the model's intended use, ensuring quality of training data, validating performance, and maintaining human oversight. In other words, the rules are evolving, but the direction is clear: if you use an AI in GMP, you must manage it with the same rigor as any other critical system. Even before explicit AI guidelines are finalized, existing computerized system regulations and data integrity principles already apply. For example, FDA's 21 CFR Part 11 and EU Annex 11 require that electronic records and software used in GMP processes are trustworthy and reliable. This includes accuracy, consistency, and auditability of outputs – areas where naive use of LMs could falter. A fundamental issue is that large language models are probabilistic, not deterministic. As one expert bluntly put it, current LLMs "produce different answers every time" to the same prompt, a non-determinism that clashes with the reproducibility required by GMP standards. If a chatbot generates five slightly different versions of a report from identical input data, how do you validate which one is "correct"? In regulated manufacturing, identical inputs should yield identical outputs – a benchmark that typical free-form AI might not meet. Another critical concern is **data integrity and traceability**. GMP requires that we know who recorded data or made a decision, and that records are attributable. If an AI assistant prepares a summary or recommendation, who is the author? If an inspector asks "Who wrote this deviation report response?" and the answer is "Uh, the chatbot did," that's a problem. Conventional systems log user IDs and actions, whereas many AI services do not inherently provide an audit trail of their decision process. As Phoebe Clough (a Qualified Person and GxP consultant) noted, "GxP environments require robust audit trails... If an inspector asks, 'Who wrote this CAPA?' and the answer is 'ChatGPT,' you're in trouble." We must be able to trace and verify the source of GMP records – a chatbot's output cannot be a black box. Data integrity also extends to accuracy and completeness of information. A known pitfall of LMs is they sometimes fabricate information (often termed "hallucination"). The model might confidently present something that isn't actually in the underlying data. For instance, it might concoct a plausible-sounding explanation or cite a requirement that doesn't exist. Pete, a GMP compliance expert, warned that "assuming the accuracy of chatbot outputs is a disaster in the making – in my opinion it is only a matter of time until the recalls and regulatory actions start" if companies trust AI answers without verification. In an inspection, if an AI-driven system gave operators incorrect guidance (say, a wrong sterilization parameter or a missed alarm condition) and it went uncorrected, the consequences could be severe. Therefore, inspectors will care: they will ask how the company prevents AI misinformation from creeping into GMP decisions. **Regulatory expectation:** If a company deploys a ChatGPT-like tool in a GMP process, they should treat it as a GxP computerized system. That means performing risk assessments, validation (IQ/OQ/PQ), and putting controls in place to ensure it operates reliably within its intended use. In fact, regulators have explicitly started scrutinizing use of AI. The FDA, EMA, MHRA and others expect firms to demonstrate that such tools are fit for purpose, validated, and used under a quality management system. If the model is making any GMP-relevant recommendations, the company must show how they ensure those recommendations are correct and compliant. Until AI models can be fully deterministic and 100% trustworthy (a frontier researchers are just beginning to tackle), the onus is on us to implement governance around them. In summary, regulators care because patient safety and data integrity are at stake. A language model may be impressive technology, but without proper controls it can introduce errors, inconsistencies, or security risks in a domain that cannot afford them. The rest of this article discusses how such an AI might be used in practice on a GMP installation and how to distinguish a well-implemented solution from a poor one.

## Scenario Context: A Chatbot for an Autoclave – What's Going On?

Let's put this into a concrete scenario. Imagine you're touring a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility and you stop by the equipment for terminal sterilization – an industrial autoclave. The operator isn't flipping through binders or scrolling a PLC screen; instead, they have a chat window open on a console. They type: "Show me the last two batch cycles and check if all parameters were in spec," and the system responds in a conversational way:

*"Cycles 105 and 106 (Feb 1, 2026): Both completed successfully. Cycle 105 had a peak temperature of 122.0°C and pressure of 2.5 bar, and Cycle 106 had a peak temperature of 121.8°C at 2.5 bar. All values are within the validated range for sterilization. No anomalies or alarms were recorded. Both batches meet the required sterilization parameters."*

They then ask, "Remind me what the SOP says about loading configurations," and the chatbot dutifully replies with a summary of the autoclave loading procedure from the manual. This feels like science fiction meeting GMP reality – the operator is literally chatting with the machine and its documentation.

[Example of a chat-based assistant interface](https://www.koerber-pharma.com/en/solutions/software/pas-x-kai) integrated into a pharma manufacturing system. Such an AI-driven chat UI allows operators to query equipment data or SOP documents in natural language and receive instant answers.

**What's happening under the hood?** In this hypothetical system, the manufacturer has integrated a language model (a ChatGPT-like AI) into the autoclave's electronic record system. The application has access to two main data sources: (1) the autoclave's process data logs (e.g. those CSV files containing each cycle's details: times, temperatures, pressures, any alarms) and (2) the autoclave's documentation (user manual, operating SOP, perhaps maintenance records). The chatbot component is designed to let the operator retrieve information from these sources quickly by simply asking questions. It's like having an intelligent assistant that knows the machine's "memory" and "instructions." From an operational standpoint, this could offer real benefits: The operator can quickly confirm if a cycle was within spec without manually cross-checking each data point. They can get guidance on procedures without thumbing through a manual – which might reduce human error (no more "I couldn't find the info, so I guessed" situations). It can also speed up troubleshooting; for example, asking "What does error code 7 mean?" could immediately pull up the relevant manual section that says error 7 is a pressure sensor fault and suggests checking the seal. In a busy manufacturing setting, saving minutes on each query and ensuring accurate info is retrieved can add up to efficiency gains. However, from a compliance and inspection perspective, this scenario raises important questions. The chatbot is effectively interpreting GMP data and controlled documents on the fly. We need to ensure it's doing that correctly and safely:

- **Accuracy:** Is the chatbot reliably pulling the correct data from those CSV files? If Cycle 105 actually had a temperature excursion, would it correctly report it? Or could it potentially misread or miscalculate something? If it summarizes an SOP, is it faithful to the source or paraphrasing incorrectly?
- **Completeness:** When asked about spec compliance, does it check all relevant parameters? (Perhaps the question only mentioned temperature and pressure, but what about time or F0 value? A human might forget to ask, and would the AI volunteer that information if it's critical?) A robust system might proactively include any out-of-spec detail in its answer, whereas a weaker one might overlook it because the question didn't explicitly ask.
- **Data Source Integrity:** Are the CSV files the actual source of truth (e.g., directly from the validated data acquisition system)? One wouldn't want the AI reading from an unapproved copy of data. Similarly, is the documentation it uses the current approved version? If the SOP was updated last month, has the chatbot's knowledge been updated, or is it quoting an old procedure?
- **Scope of the AI's Knowledge:** Is the AI strictly limited to the autoclave's data and documents? Ideally, yes – we want a narrow, domain-specific AI assistant. A worrying scenario would be if the chatbot also has general internet or broad knowledge. For instance, if it's connected to a general AI model that wasn't fine-tuned, it might start giving advice beyond the local documentation (e.g. "I recall a case where someone used a different cycle profile..." based on training data from elsewhere). That could be dangerous or simply non-applicable. A good implementation keeps the AI focused on the task-specific content.
- **User Reliance and Training:** Are operators trained on how to use this chatbot appropriately? Do they know its limitations? For example, maybe the SOP says the operator must still review the full cycle printout – the chatbot is just an aid, not the official record. If staff start to rely solely on the AI's answer without cross-checking, a mistake could slip through. As an inspector, you'd want to gauge how the human+AI interaction is managed in practice.

In this scenario, an inspector should certainly address the chatbot during the inspection. It's part of the integrated system and is being used to support GMP decisions (batch release considerations, adherence to SOPs, etc.). The key is not to treat the AI as a magical black box, but to verify that it has been implemented in compliance with GMP principles. In the next section, we differentiate what a "good" implementation of such an AI assistant looks like versus a "poor" one, so you know what to applaud or to challenge.

## Good vs. Bad: Implementations of a GMP Chatbot

Not all AI applications are equal. A ChatGPT-like app in a GMP environment could be a well-controlled, valuable tool – or it could be a risky, sloppy shortcut. This section outlines characteristics of good (compliant) implementations and bad (non-compliant) ones, focusing on the chatbot component. Think of this as a contrast between best practices and red flags.

### Characteristics of a Good (Compliant) Implementation

- **Domain-Limited Knowledge Base:** The AI's responses are based only on approved, GMP-relevant data – for example, it uses the autoclave's official log files and the current approved SOP/manual. It's not drawing from random internet data or outdated documents. By constraining the model's knowledge to static, validated datasets, the outputs are more consistent and reliable. In practice, this might be achieved via a private local model or a retrieval system that feeds the model only the relevant snippets of local data for each query.
- **Validation of Performance:** The company has treated the chatbot like any other computerized system and validated its functionality. There would be documented test cases where they challenged the chatbot with all sorts of typical and edge-case questions and verified the answers. For example, tests like: "Ask about a known out-of-spec event – does it correctly flag it?" or "Query a specific SOP step – does the answer match the SOP exactly?" If the AI is expected to perform calculations or interpretations, those are checked against manual calculations. Essentially, there's evidence that the AI consistently does what it's supposed to, across a range of scenarios, with acceptable accuracy and consistency. If an inspector asks to see how the system was validated, the company can produce that documentation.
- **Deterministic Behavior (or Controlled Variability):** To address the reproducibility concern, a good implementation will aim for consistent outputs. This could mean the AI is configured to use a fixed response mode (no random sampling) so that given the same question and context, it will respond the same way every time. Alternatively, if minor phrasing differences are allowed, the substance of the answer will remain the same. The key is that two operators asking the same question shouldn't get conflicting answers. Consistency is critical for compliance – it ensures that the "record" of what the chatbot said is reliable. Modern AI tooling allows developers to adjust the temperature setting (which controls randomness); a compliant system might dial this down or use an approach that gives predictable results. The goal is to avoid the non-determinism inherent in raw AI models that regulators find incompatible with GMP documentation.
- **Transparency and Traceability:** A well-designed GMP chatbot will show its work or at least its sources. For example, the interface might provide references or links alongside the AI's answer: "According to Autoclave SOP Section 5.3…" or "Cycle data from 01-Feb-2026:" This allows the user (and an inspector) to trace the answer back to the original source. It's similar to how we expect an analyst to cite data – the AI should too. Even if the chatbot itself doesn't visibly cite, the system logs should record what source data was retrieved or which documents were used to compose the answer. This way, if there's any doubt, one can verify the answer's origin. Traceability is also enhanced by audit trails: a good implementation will log all queries made by users and the AI's responses. This log becomes part of the electronic record (subject to review just like any decision log). If an inspector says, "Show me what was asked and answered regarding batch #123," the company can retrieve the chat history for that batch query. Robust audit trails and data logs are fundamental to data integrity.
- **Data Integrity and Security Controls:** In a good setup, no GMP data leaves the controlled environment without proper safeguards. Ideally, the AI model runs on-premises or in a qualified cloud under the company's control. If an external AI service must be used, the data is anonymized or minimal, and agreements are in place to ensure confidentiality. The system would also have user access controls – e.g., only authorized personnel can use the chatbot for certain functions (perhaps via login or role-based permissions). And just like any GMP system, it should be password-protected, time-out when idle, etc., to maintain security.
- **Defined Intended Use and Limits:** A compliant implementation clearly defines what the chatbot is and isn't allowed to do. For instance, it might be intended only as an informational assistant for operators, but not for making final quality decisions. The SOP for using the system would state that it's a tool to assist, and that final decisions (like batch release) require human assessment of the official records. By defining its intended use, the company can put boundaries on the AI's role. The AI might also be configured to refuse answering questions outside its scope. If you suddenly ask our autoclave bot about something unrelated (like "How many products were shipped today?"), a disciplined assistant should respond with an error or no answer, indicating it's not programmed for that. This prevents misuse.
- **Error Handling and Uncertainty:** A good system acknowledges when it doesn't know something. If the data isn't available or the question is ambiguous, the AI will either ask for clarification or say it cannot confidently answer. This is much better than it guessing. For example, if an operator asks a very broad question like "Is everything okay with the autoclave?", a careful AI might respond, "Which aspect would you like to check? (e.g., recent cycle performance, maintenance status)" rather than making an unwarranted blanket statement. By programming the AI (or training it) to express uncertainty or to decline answers beyond its training, the developers avoid the pitfall of AI hallucination. In GMP, saying "I don't know" is far safer than a wrong guess!
- **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:** Even after deployment, a good implementation doesn't go on autopilot forever. The company will monitor the AI's performance over time – for instance, reviewing a sample of its Q&A sessions periodically to ensure it's still accurate. They will have a change control procedure for the AI. If the underlying model is updated or retrained (or if the vendor updates their AI engine), that change is assessed for risk and possibly triggers a re-validation. Essentially, they treat the AI like any piece of software that needs version control and maintenance. Continuous oversight is something regulators are emphasizing (draft Annex 22 calls for ongoing model performance monitoring and human review as needed).
- **User Training and SOPs:** Lastly, a solid implementation comes with proper training for users and written procedures. Operators and QA personnel are trained on how to use the chatbot appropriately: what types of questions to ask, how to interpret answers, and the need to verify critical information. There might be an SOP titled "Use of AI Assistant for Autoclave Data Retrieval" that spells out steps, responsibilities, and limitations (e.g., "If the Assistant reports an out-of-spec, the operator must still cross-verify with the original electronic record" or "If the Assistant provides an SOP instruction, the operator must ensure it matches the official SOP version in Document Control"). This ensures that humans remain in the loop and that the AI doesn't inadvertently become the sole source of truth without oversight.

In sum, a good implementation is one that integrates the AI into the quality system, much like any other tool – with clear controls, validation, and accountability. The AI becomes a helpful servant, not a rogue element.

### Characteristics of a Poor (Non-compliant) Implementation

Now, let's look at the other side: how might a chatGPT-like app be deployed in a sloppy or risky way in a GMP setting? Recognizing these red flags will help inspectors zero in on potential problems:

- **Unrestricted or General-Purpose AI Use:** This is when a company just plugs in a general AI (say, calling the public ChatGPT API) without any fine-tuning or restrictions, and uses it to answer GMP questions. The AI might have the entire internet in its head, but that's not a controlled knowledge base. For example, instead of ensuring only the official autoclave manual is used, a naive implementation might rely on the model's pre-training. The result? The chatbot could hallucinate procedures or limits that sound plausible but aren't actually from the company's documents. It might say something like, "You should recalibrate the autoclave sensor weekly," when the SOP says monthly – simply because it "learned" some generic best practice from public data. Using an off-the-shelf model without curating its knowledge is a recipe for misinformation.
- **Lack of Validation or Testing:** A poor implementation treats the chatbot as a black box and assumes it works. There's no documented validation testing specific to the company's use case. If you ask for evidence of its accuracy, they might say "Well, it uses ChatGPT, which is pretty accurate generally." That's not acceptable in GMP. The absence of a formal qualification/validation means nobody systematically checked whether the AI might give wrong answers for certain queries. Essentially, the company is flying blind on trust in the vendor or technology hype. This is a huge red flag: unvalidated software in a GMP environment is a compliance no-go.
- **Inconsistent Outputs (Non-determinism):** You might notice that the system's answers vary widely. Today it says one thing, tomorrow something slightly different to the same query. This variability might confuse operators and will certainly alarm inspectors. It indicates the AI is not configured for consistency. In the worst cases, it could even contradict itself – e.g., two repetitions of a query about whether a cycle was within spec yield two slightly different summaries, or perhaps one time it omits a detail it mentioned the first time. Such inconsistency undermines trust and traceability, and as discussed, it violates the expectation of reproducibility for electronic records.
- **No Audit Trail or Record:** A poorly implemented chatbot might not log interactions. Imagine the operator asks the AI about a deviation, the AI gives some advice, and the operator proceeds with that – but there's no record of this Q&A anywhere. Later, an investigator might see a decision was made but can't trace how. If the system doesn't store the queries and responses (with timestamps and user IDs), it fails the audit trail requirement. As an inspector, if you ask to see how the chatbot has been used, a bad system would have no answer. It's as if decisions were made "off the record," which is unacceptable. (Remember the earlier quote: if the inspector asks "who wrote this?" and the answer is "the chatbot," you're in trouble – doubly so if you can't even prove what the chatbot actually said.)
- **Data Integrity Gaps:** In a shoddy setup, the integration might be such that the AI could even alter data or present it in a misleading way without controls. For instance, what if the chatbot "summarizes" a data trend and in doing so, averages some values or drops some datapoints? If those transformations aren't specified and controlled, you could lose fidelity of the original data. Or maybe the AI interface allows input of data in a free-text form (imagine chatting "Log a maintenance event: replaced gasket" and it writes to a log). If that were the case, how do you ensure the entry is attributable and formatted correctly? These kinds of designs blur the line between human and machine record-keeping in a bad way. Anything that undermines ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, etc.) is a serious issue. For example, if the chatbot's answer is considered the official record of an interpretation, is it Original and Accurate? If not managed, it might not be.
- **External Communication without Control:** A big red flag is if the AI requires internet access or sends data to a third-party server (like an AI cloud service) without proper qualification and security. GMP data going to an external service can violate data integrity and confidentiality requirements if not carefully controlled. In a poor implementation, the team might not have considered this – the machine is connected online, queries are being processed on OpenAI or Google servers somewhere, and there may be no guarantee who can see that data or how it's used. Moreover, if the model is hosted externally, it might be updated by the provider without the company knowing (e.g., the AI could change behavior from one day to the next due to a behind-the-scenes model update, blowing your validation out of the water). Without a formal supplier assessment and technical agreement covering an AI service, this is a major compliance gap.
- **Over-Reliance and Lack of Human Oversight:** On the process side, a poor scenario is when operators have been given this tool but not instructed on its limits. If the culture becomes "the chatbot is always right," people might stop double-checking its answers. As the LinkedIn article warned, over-reliance is dangerous – if the team lacks the skills or attentiveness to catch AI mistakes, errors will go unchecked. For instance, if the chatbot incorrectly says a batch is fine and no one verifies the raw data, an issue might be missed. In a bad implementation, there is no SOP or training emphasizing the "trust but verify" approach.
- **No Defined Scope (AI doing more than it should):** Perhaps the chatbot started as a simple help tool, but without restrictions it's now being used for tasks beyond its design. Maybe someone decides to use it to draft an entire deviation investigation report or write a batch record entry. If it wasn't designed and validated for those uses, you now have uncontrolled use of the AI in GMP documentation. A red flag is an AI that's essentially writing GMP records (like drafting a CAPA or deviation response) without proper controls. Not only does that raise authorship and accuracy questions, but it's very likely unvalidated. As Clough pointed out, trying to use ChatGPT to handle critical quality system documentation without an enormous validation effort is just not worth it – and a half-baked attempt to do so will stick out as non-compliance.
- **No Ongoing Monitoring or Maintenance:** A bad implementation follows a "set it and forget it" mindset. Once the AI is put in, nobody periodically checks if it's still behaving. There's no plan for re-evaluation. The risk here is that over time, data patterns might change (maybe a new type of cycle or new SOP revisions come in) and the AI might not cope well, yet no one notices until a mistake is made. If the company isn't reviewing the chatbot's outputs once in a while or capturing user feedback, they could be missing a degradation in performance or emerging bias. In contrast, a good implementation as mentioned would have continuous oversight.

In summary, a poor implementation is characterized by lack of control: no clear boundaries on the AI's knowledge or use, no proper validation/testing, no audit trails, and no respect for data integrity fundamentals. It often stems from either overconfidence in the AI or a lack of understanding of regulatory requirements. During an inspection, these weaknesses would manifest as the company being unable to answer detailed questions about how the AI works, how it was tested, or how its output is governed.

## Inspector's Checklist: Evaluating an AI Chatbot on Site

If you encounter a ChatGPT-like system in a GMP environment, here are some practical steps and questions to help you assess it. This checklist can guide you in identifying whether the implementation aligns with good practices or if there are glaring issues:

- **Understand the Scope:** Ask "What is the intended use of this AI application?" and "What GMP decisions or tasks does it influence?" You want to know if it's purely a convenience tool for reference or if it's actively used in batch release decisions, deviations, etc. The broader its usage, the more scrutiny it deserves. A well-run site should have a clear description of the system's purpose.
- **Data Sources:** Inquire "Where does the chatbot get its information?" The answer should ideally be specific (e.g., "it pulls from database X and the approved PDF manual in our document management system"). If they say "from the AI's general knowledge" or they're not sure, that's a red flag. Verify that sources are official and controlled. You might follow up with "How do you update its knowledge when procedures or specifications change?" to ensure there's a process for keeping it current.
- **Validation Evidence:** Request to see the validation or testing documentation for the chatbot. For example, "Show me the test cases you executed to verify the chatbot's accuracy and consistency." Look for tests covering various scenarios (normal queries, challenging queries, wrong inputs). If they can produce a validation report with outcomes, it's a good sign. If not, phrase it as "How did you satisfy yourself that this tool is accurate and fit for use?" and see if the answer is convincing or vague.
- **Demonstration (Consistency Test):** Consider asking for a quick live demonstration. For instance, "Please ask the chatbot the same question twice" or "Ask it for yesterday's data, then ask in a slightly different way." Observe if the answers are consistent and correct. As an inspector, you can also pose a question (through the operator or system owner) – perhaps something you know the answer to from reviewing records. This isn't to play stump-the-bot, but to see it in action. If it gives an inconsistent or incorrect response, that's immediately noteworthy.
- **Handling Uncertainty:** You might test how it deals with unknowns: "What happens if you ask it something outside its knowledge domain?" A good system might refuse or respond cautiously. A bad one might spout nonsense. For example, have them ask a question that the data doesn't cover (like a future prediction or a what-if scenario) and see if it tries to fabricate an answer.
- **Audit Trail:** Ask "Does the system maintain a log of all queries and responses? Can we see an example?" The goal is to confirm there's an audit trail. If the system has an admin interface or log file, they might show you a record like: [2026-02-01 14:35] User A asked 'X'; AI responded 'Y'. If such logs exist, check if they include timestamp, user ID, and perhaps source references. If no one can show a log and they say "It doesn't record that," highlight that as a data integrity gap.
- **Security & Access Control:** Confirm how the system is accessed. "Do users need to log in to use the chatbot? How do you ensure only authorized personnel use it?" Also, "Is the AI processing done locally or does it go to a cloud service?" If external, ask about the supplier assessment: "Have you qualified the vendor providing this AI service? How do you protect the data sent over?" The answers should reveal whether data could be exposed and whether the company has thought about those risks.
- **Error Cases:** Ask if they've encountered any incorrect answers or issues. "Has the chatbot ever given an answer that was wrong or unexpected? If so, what did you do?" A transparent, quality-focused team would admit if it happened and explain how they addressed it (perhaps retraining the model or adjusting prompts, etc.). If they claim it's never wrong, that might indicate they haven't looked hard enough or are overconfident.
- **Change Control & Monitoring:** Query their change control process for the AI: "If the AI model or its configuration needs an update, how is that managed?" and "Do you periodically review its performance or revalidate it?" This checks if they treat it like a living system that requires oversight. You can mention the concept of ongoing monitoring – they should at least say something about reviewing logs or retraining when data changes.
- **User Training and SOPs:** "How are operators trained to use this tool?" and "Is there an SOP or work instruction for it?" See if they have documentation instructing users on proper use. A good sign is if they show you a training record or an SOP that includes steps like "verify the chatbot's answer against source data if critical" etc. If end-users are left to figure it out on their own, that's concerning.
- **Contingency Plans:** Finally, ask "What if the chatbot is unavailable or not working? Can the task be done without it?" This indirectly tells you how much they rely on it and whether they have a backup (like, yes we can still manually retrieve the data). In GMP, reliance on a single system should come with contingency planning. If they stutter here, it might mean they leaned too heavily on an unproven tool.

Using this checklist approach, you can systematically evaluate the chatbot's compliance footprint. It helps the firm as well – sometimes the questions you ask may prompt them to address gaps they hadn't considered. The goal isn't to discourage innovation; it's to ensure that when innovation is used, it's done in a controlled, quality-assured way.

## Conclusion

So, do we care about a ChatGPT-like app in GMP environments? **Yes, we do** – and we should. Language model-powered chatbots represent a new frontier in how people interact with complex data and documents. In a GMP setting, they hold promise for making information more accessible, reducing manual effort, and possibly even minimizing certain errors. An operator asking an AI assistant for guidance can be more efficient than flipping through a 300-page manual. However, with great power comes great responsibility (to borrow a phrase). If left unchecked, the same technology could introduce inaccuracies, hide the provenance of information, or erode the rigour of decision-making – all of which conflict with the strict requirements of pharmaceutical manufacturing. For regulatory inspectors and QA professionals, the emergence of AI in the production environment means adapting our approach: we must understand the technology enough to ask the right questions, and apply existing principles to novel situations. At the time of writing, regulatory agencies are actively working on specific guidance for AI (the draft EU GMP Annex 22 is one example), but even in its absence, the timeless GMP principles still guide us: know your process (or system), ensure it's under control, and be able to demonstrate that it consistently does what it should do. Whether a decision is made by a human or suggested by an AI, it's the manufacturer's responsibility to ensure it's made correctly and documented properly. In the example of our autoclave assistant, a well-implemented chatbot can be part of a compliant workflow – but it doesn't exempt the company from following the validation, data integrity, and oversight expectations that come with any electronic system. Inspectors shouldn't be intimidated by the fancy tech; at the end of the day, ask the same kind of questions you'd ask of any software tool that helps run the facility. Does it help maintain compliance, or is it a convenience that might be masking non-compliance? To the GMP firms experimenting with these tools, the message is: innovation is welcome, but do it wisely. Engage your Quality Assurance early, perform thorough risk assessments, and don't let the hype outpace your quality system. There are good ways to harness AI (some we outlined, like domain-specific training, robust validation, etc.), which can coexist with GMP compliance. In fact, regulators acknowledge the potential benefits – the push to update guidelines shows an intent to allow AI in a regulated framework, not to ban it. In conclusion, a chatGPT-like app on a GMP installation is neither inherently good nor bad – it's all about how it's implemented and used. As inspectors and quality professionals, we do care and we will pay attention. By recognizing the signs of a well-controlled AI vs a careless one, we can both foster technological advancement and uphold the high standards of product quality and patient safety that GMP is all about. The next time you encounter a friendly chatbot on the shop floor, greet it with a healthy dose of curiosity and skepticism, and use what you've learned here to ensure it's an asset, not a liability, in our regulated world.
